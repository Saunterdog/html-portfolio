<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>Funny, heartbreaking and remarkably loving</p>

<p>Impossible to choose between the three, these incredible stories have clung to my soul. Plus, I really enjoy the food scenes.</p>
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>The science fiction/fantasy mashup that defined a generation and then the ones that followed.</p>
